# mkCursorClip
Lock mouse to screen or specific area

## Description
Don't you just hate it? When playing in window mode and suddenly the window is no longer in focus, because you clicked outside of it?
Yes... me too.

And because it annoyed me I've written this little application. It provides a keyboard shortcut to trap your cursor in a window, be it a game or any other program.

## Features
* Configurable hotkeys
* Configurable padding from application border
* Simple and lightweight
* Uses modified version of http://keyboardmousehooks.codeplex.com/ for hotkey handling
* The project is mirrored at https://bitbucket.org/slayit/mkcursorclip/

## How-to

1. It's pretty simple.
1. Download the current release
1. Start it
1. Press the configured hotkeys (default is left-shift + <) and watch your cursor struggle to come out of the current window!
1. Optional: Right-click the tray icon and configure it for your own needs in the settings dialog

# Why?!!!
I found it on codeplex.com, they said they are going down December 15th, 2017. It's license is MIT. Mirrored at bitbucket.org. Decided another mirror can't hurt and maybe I might just want to dabble in C# too.
